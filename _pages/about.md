<!-- Hi! I am Siteng Huang (黄思腾 in Chinese). I am a joint Ph.D. student of [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/) and [Westlake University](https://www.westlake.edu.cn/), advised by Prof. [Donglin Wang](https://en.westlake.edu.cn/about/faculty/201912/t20191206_2513.shtml). And I am a member of [Machine Intelligence Laboratory (MiLAB)](https://milab.westlake.edu.cn/) in Westlake University, and currently also a research intern at <a href="https://damo.alibaba.com/" target="_blank">DAMO Academy, Alibaba Group</a>. Prior to my Ph.D. career, I received my B.Eng. Degree from School of Computer Science, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2019. -->
Hi! I am Xingchen Ding (丁星辰 in Chinese). I am a Postgraduate student of [Wuhan University](http://www.whu.edu.cn/), currently immersing myself in academic pursuits within the [Wuhan University Language and Cognitive Computing Laboratory](http://lacc.whu.edu.cn/home), led by the distinguished Prof. [Donghong Ji](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=2Q-7u3AAAAAJ). Prior to my Postgraduate career, I received my B.S. Degree from School of Resource and Environmental Sciences, [Wuhan University](https://www.whu.edu.cn/) in 2019, and then I gained industry experience as a Software Development Engineer at TCL Technology Group Corporation.
<!-- TCL Commercial Information Technology Co., Ltd.  -->

<span style="color:red;">I am <b>seeking exciting research opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. degree after Postgraduate graduation (June 2024)</b>. Please feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:xingos1342@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a> if you are interested!</span>

<h2 id='research-interests'>Research Interests</h2>

<!-- I am interested in technologies that allow machines and robots to learn like humans. In particular, I am committed to giving robots the ability to understand the world and learn from previous experiences, so that they can complete new tasks, acquire new skills or adapt to new environments rapidly with fewer samples through learning algorithms. Currently, my areas of interest include meta-learning, multi-task learning, and transfer learning on few/zero-shot learning tasks. I am also interested in deep learning, computer vision, and multimodal machine learning. -->

Currently, my research has centered on

* **AIGC**: graph-to-text generation (G2T), customized & controllable generation
* **Social-media data mining**: fake new detection, social emotion analysis, rumor detection, social psychological analysis
* **Multi-modal large models**: parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT / PETL), vision-language pre-trained models (VLM), text-video retrieval (TVR)
* **Data-efficient learning**: few-shot learning (FSL), compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL), meta-learning
* **Other fascinating areas**: federated learing, graph learning, reinforcement learning, unsupervised domain adaptation

I am always looking for related colaboration. If you are interested to chat with me, feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:xingos1342@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>.

<!-- In the longer term, I am more concerned about

* giving robots the ability to understand the world and learn from previous experiences, so that they can complete new tasks, acquire new skills or adapt to new environments rapidly with fewer samples through learning algorithms. -->

<!-- 
1. 快速迁移，尤其是大模型
2. 机器人的主动学习，感知智能与行为智能 embodied
3. 开放世界
